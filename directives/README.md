# Directives

This folder contains **SOPs (Standard Operating Procedures)** written in Markdown.

## Purpose

Each directive defines:
- **Goal**: What needs to be accomplished
- **Inputs**: What data/parameters are needed
- **Tools/Scripts**: Which execution scripts to use
- **Outputs**: What the result should look like
- **Edge Cases**: Known issues, API limits, error handling

## How to Use

1. Before starting any task, check if a directive exists for it
2. Follow the directive step by step
3. If you learn something new (API limits, better approaches), update the directive
4. Directives are living documents - they improve over time

## Naming Convention

Use descriptive names in snake_case:
- `scrape_website.md`
- `generate_proposal.md`
- `sync_to_sheets.md`
